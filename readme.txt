This project was made for the 2022 GMTK Gamejam. A friend and I were given 48 hours to make a game with the theme roll of the dice. All coding and game development within unity was done by me, most of the art and level design was done by my friend, and we both contributed relatively equally on game design. A few extra changes were made after the jam to make the game more presentable and fix a few minor bugs (maybe 6 hours of work).
